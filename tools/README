The tools here are basically "maintainer tools":

* create-cairo-defs.sh: This is used to create the cairo.def files in
  cairo/src. It so much easier to write a shell script than trying to
  do that with a batch file. When cairo is updated, this needs to be
  ran in the src directory to update the defs file.

* create-packager-bat.sh: This is used to create the gtkpackager batch
  file. If any files should be added to the package, add it to this
  file and run it to create the gtkpackager.bat script.

  IMPORTANT: If you run this to update the packager script, MAKE SURE
  you have a debug build done successfully, since the list is
  generated from what files are actually built.
